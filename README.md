# Mark-Calculator
A simple Mark Calculator application that allows users input grades for any course and calculates there current mark in the class aswell what grades are needed to pass the course. It also calculates overall semester average of all courses.

Limitatons
- I wasnt able to make it responsive and it would be something that I would work on if I came back and worked on the application
- I feel like I could have designed a better User interface however this was my first time with iOS
- Only works with iOS and not Android. I should have done this in React :/
